# MD-Lab
Implements PIMD simulation of fictitious identical particles based on the quadratic scaling MD algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18025).

This page only includes the source code of the library itself. For tests and applications to quantum many body systems such as trapped particles and UEG see the release section https://github.com/xiongyunuo/MD-Lab/releases.
